	Safe Cracker Door for Unix.
	---------------------------

This is a safe cracker door game for Unix. To compile and install this
package you need doorlib installed on your system. 

The safe-door binary should be called with the full filename and path to the 
configuration file. 

The safe-tool is to be used by the sysop and is a tool to reset the user who
has cracked the safe. The sysop must be in the same Unix group as your bbs 
users. On MBSE BBS user "mbse" would be a good choice. Call the safe-tool with
the full filename and path to the configuration file.


	Installation of the door in MBSE BBS:

After building, compiling and installing all files will be in place. If you
upgrade from 0.9.0, you need to copy the safe-config file from the examples
directory yourself to the etc dir (default /usr/local/etc/safe). Edit what
is needed. For multiple lanuages, make a copy of this file for each language.
Use the right config file for the right language from your bbs setup.

Then start mbsetup menu 8.3 and open the menu where you want to install
the safe cracker door in. Edit a menu item:
